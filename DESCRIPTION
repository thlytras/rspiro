Description: This package implements the GLI-2012 (Quanjer) 
    spirometry equations in R. It allows user-friendly 
    calculation of predicted (mean normal) and LLN (Lower 
    Limit of Normal) values, as well as converting absolute 
    measurements to percent (%) predicted, for the whole range 
    of spirometric parameters (FEV1, FVC, FEV1FVC, etc).
    More equations (Hankinson, etc) are to be added later.
