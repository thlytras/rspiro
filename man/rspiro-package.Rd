\title{rspiro: Brief overview of the package}
\description{
R package \bold{rspiro} implements multiple spirometry equations: 
currently the GLI-2012 (Quanjer), GLI global 2022, JRS-2014 
and NHANES III (Hankinson), with 
potentially more to be added later. It offers a convenient interface
to calculate predicted or LLN (Lower Limit of Normal) values given
demographic data, or to convert absolute spirometry values to percent (%) 
predicted or z-scores.
}
\details{
To ensure a consistent interface, 
package functions are named with a prefix indicating the functionality 
and a suffix indicating the spirometric equations used, for example 
\code{\link{LLN_GLI}} calculates Lower Limits of Normal using the GLI-2012
equations. The suffix is currently one of 'GLI', 'GLIgl', 'JRS' or 'NHANES3'. 
The prefix is one of 'LLN_', 'pred_', 'pctpred_' or 'zscore_'. 

Functions
prefixed 'LLN_' or 'pred_' accept as input demographic information (age,
gender, height, ethnicity) and calculate the Lower Limit of Normal and
the predicted value, respectively, for a given spirometry parameter (FEV1,
FVC, etc). 
Functions prefixed 'pctpred_' or 'zscore_' accept absolute spirometry 
values (plus demographics) and convert those to percent (%) predicted and
z-scores, respectively. 
Please note the difference between 'pred_' and 'pctpred_' above.

For detailed information, refer to the respective function documentations.
