### rspiro - Spirometry equations for R

Package `rspiro` implements multiple spirometry equations: currently
the GLI-2012 (Quanjer), race-neutral GLI global (2022), NHANES III (Hankinson)
and JRS-2014, with potentially more to be added later. 

It offers user-friendly functions to calculate predicted or LLN 
(Lower Limit of Normal) values given demographic data, or to convert 
absolute spirometry values to percent (%) predicted or z-scores.

**Installation**

Open R, and give:

      devtools::install_github("thlytras/rspiro")

If you do not have the package "devtools", first install it from CRAN with:

      install.packages("devtools")
